          Since the Convergence, the physical world has become a shadow of itself. Multiple realities -- each of them alike, yet altogether different -- are now one and the same. Time and Space are relative. Reality is but an illusion; and within that illusion, life goes on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, several hundred years after the Convergence, society has reappeared atop the shaky foundations of this strange new world of magic and machine. Whether from Kolob, the Sovereignty, or some other place and time altogether, the survivors of the Convergence who once found this place unfamiliar now call it their home, building new lives amongst the ruins of monuments from many different worlds. With society comes progress; with progress comes opportunity. What does this broken land hold in store for you? Prosperity? Power? A cruel, cruel fate?

          The moon is watching.<br />
          The Tower is waiting.<br />
          The gods are silent.

          Go forth, child. Make this world your own... while there is still time.
