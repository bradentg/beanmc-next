          The Farmer was a simple girl with big dreams. She wanted to make sure that no one in the world would go hungry and planted many fruit trees and fields, earning the land&apos;s name: <WikiLink href="../sites/orchard">The Orchard</WikiLink>. Once the trees and fields were planted, the farmer turned her focus to magic as she felt some flow through her while she was planting her fields. The Farmer was happily going about her life, tending to crops, building up the land, and learning magic until one day when a man calling himself <WikiLink href="meme">Emperor Meme</WikiLink> came upon her land and declared that technology was the only way to go. That was the day <WikiLink href="../events/thefeud">The Feud of Magic and Technology</WikiLink> was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          Farmer Rosey refused to believe that Technology was the only way to go, so she decided to prove the emperor wrong. The Orchard became as what&apos;s known as Technophobic by the Imperium, declared only by Emperor Meme.
