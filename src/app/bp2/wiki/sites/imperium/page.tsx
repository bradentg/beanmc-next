        <p>
          A very large, mainly capitalist country with large organizational structure, fairly forgiving military budget, and some of the most forgiving tax laws in the land, and with little to no regulations on free enterprise along with one of the most productive industrial centers in the world, and only the most advanced technology, it stands that the Imperium is likely to be a powerhouse nation, for as long as the growth can be maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its capital city is the City of Embers, where most of the Administratum duties are performed. the city is also home to the most recent expansion in the industrial sector, and with a couple of multinational corporations planning on bringing their HQ&apos;s and subsequently their business and jobs, it would be no wonder that this is the place to see growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the organizational structure it has 3 main organizations within it, the not ever mentioned Ecclesiarchy, the Ever famous Administratum, and the Departmento Militarum, along with the Imperium&apos;s thriving private sector. It also has two other sites that are known to exist, MilFac 1 and the Archives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Else of note is that the military portion of the Imperium is formed of the now defunct MemeCorp and has been working well ever since.

        <p>
          A city of the Deep in District 1 of the Imperium territory.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is also the Political Capital of the Imperium with Administratum Taxation office, and the Imperial Immigration Office. The City also contains the Warehouse Workshop of the Imperium Militaria, and the Headquarters of many Imperial companies. With a large project conducted by the Departmentum Laborum to connect the City of Embers to <WikiLink href="beangapore">Beangapore</WikiLink>. The Administratum also operates an FOIA office in the city, but not to be confused, this is not the location of the archives.

      <section id="administratum" className="space-y-5 mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-2xl text-blue-700">Imperial Administratum</h2>
        <p>
          Also known just as the &apos;Administratum&apos; it is by far the largest organization in the Imperium. Many of the Administratum&apos;s duties range from tax collection to record-keeping to regulation changes, and is run by the records master, who is currently the Emperor but this position is not always run by the same individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important site for the Administratum is the archives, only the records master and the council of administrators are allowed in the archives, and not without the blessing of the records master, every form ever entered, every report filed, every request filled, a copy of all of those records can be found at the archives. The location of the archives are unknown even to the highest elites of the imperium, other than the records master. It&apos;s location is a very closely guarded secret as are the archives themselves, in fact nobody has a photograph of the archives, even from the outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Administratum also has ultimate authority of many of the civilian departments, such as the Departmento Laborum, and has some jurisdiction over the Adeptus Astartes, but how much is only known between those organizations. The Administratum has authority of budgets and usually handles court cases as well by using the Departmento Judicium.

        <h2 className="text-2xl text-blue-700">Administratum Archives</h2>
        <p>
          The Archives of the Administratum are a site of great importance to the Administratum as it is the location of all records that the Administratum are located, as such only the top of the top are allowed in the archives, there are no photos of the outside, nor inside, either way not much else is known about this place.

The factory bridge is mainly owned by the departmento militarum, and is not accessible to the public, and in February 13th there was a public announcement by the departmento militarum that people seen on the factory bridge would be shot on sight, and as far as we are aware of, the factory is almost complete in its mission.

          MilFac 1 is also the site of the Imperium&apos;s first nuclear reactor, and by extension the <WikiLink href="../events/nuclearmishaps">nuclear mishap</WikiLink>.
